### Executive Summary: The $0 Strategy

To keep this professional and free, we will avoid free website builders (like Wix or Weebly free tiers) because they place unsightly ads on your site and use unprofessional domain names.

Instead, we will use the "Static Site" approach:

* **Technology:** HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript (using a pre-made template).
* **Code Storage:** GitHub (Free).
* **Hosting & Deployment:** Netlify or Vercel (Free tiers are excellent for professional use).
* **Domain:** Initially, you will use a free subdomain (e.g., `inkyourfit.netlify.app`).
* *Note: The only thing I highly recommend spending money on eventually is a custom domain (e.g., https://www.google.com/search?q=inkyourfit.com), which costs about $10-$15/year. But for now, we stick to the free plan.*

### Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Define what the website needs to do and who it is for. Don't touch code yet.

1. **Define Website Objectives:**
* Since you do customized apparel, the primary goal is likely lead generation (getting people to contact you for a quote) rather than direct e-commerce (which usually costs money for secure payment gateways).
* Secondary goal: Showcasing your portfolio of past work.


2. **Target Audience Analysis:**
* Who are they? (e.g., Corporates looking for swag, individuals wanting unique gifts, sports teams).
* What information do they need immediately? (Pricing estimates, turnaround time, material quality).


3. **Sitemap Creation (The Blueprint):**
Define the essential pages. For a start-up, keep it lean:
* **Home:** Hero image, brief introduction, call to action (CTA), testimonials snippet.
* **How It Works / Process:** Explaining how a customer gets from an idea to a finished "inked" product.
* **Portfolio / Gallery:** High-quality images of your work.
* **About Us:** Your story and mission behind "inkyourfit."
* **Contact/Get a Quote:** A form or clear contact details.



---

### Phase 2: Design & Content Gathering (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal:** Gather everything that will go onto the site. This is usually the hardest phase.

1. **Visual Identity:**
* Ensure you have high-resolution PNG and SVG versions of the logos we created previously.
* Define your color palette based on the logo (deep blues, purples, charcoal, and a contrasting action color like orange).


2. **Content Writing (Copy):**
* Write the text for every page defined in your sitemap.
* *Pro Tip for "inkyourfit":* Focus on benefits, not just features. Don't just say "We use high-quality ink." Say "Our prints remain vibrant wash after wash, ensuring your custom fit lasts."


3. **Photography (Crucial Step):**
* Since you sell physical, customized goods, photos are everything.
* Gather high-quality photos of your best work. Use natural lighting and simple backgrounds.
* **Free Tool:** Use free stock photo sites like Unsplash or Pexels *only* for generic background images if needed, but *never* for your portfolio.

### Phase 3: Development - The $0 Approach (Weeks 5-7)

**Goal:** Build the actual website structure using free resources.

1. **Choose a Free HTML5 Template:**
* Don't start from scratch. Download a high-quality, responsive (mobile-friendly) HTML5/CSS template.
* **Resource:** Go to sites like "HTML5 UP", "Themewagon" (free section), or "Start Bootstrap". Look for a "Portfolio" or "Small Business" template that looks clean.


2. **Customization (Using VS Code):**
* Open the template files in VS Code.
* Replace the template's images with your images.
* Replace filler text (Lorem Ipsum) with the content you wrote in Phase 2.
* Update the CSS file to match the "inkyourfit" color palette. This requires some basic knowledge of HTML/CSS, but there are many free tutorials online.


3. **The Contact Form Challenge:**
* Standard HTML forms don't work on static sites without a backend.
* **Free Solution:** Use **Formspree** or **Netlify Forms**. They provide a free tier that lets you connect your HTML form to their service, and they email you the submissions.



---

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 8)

**Goal:** Move the site from your computer to the internet, completely free.

1. **Testing:**
* Open your site in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
* **Crucial:** Open it on your phone. Does it look good on mobile? (More than 60% of your traffic will be mobile).
* Check for broken links and typos.


2. **Push to GitHub:**
* Upload your website folder (HTML, CSS, Images) to a new repository in your GitHub account.


3. **Deployment via Netlify (Recommended Free Host):**
* Go to Netlify.com and sign up for a free account using your GitHub login.
* Click "New site from Git."
* Select your "inkyourfit" repository.
* Click "Deploy Site."
* *Within seconds, your site will be live on a URL like `inkyourfit-randomname.netlify.app`.*


4. **Domain Setup (Free Version):**
* In Netlify settings, change the site name to something cleaner, like `inkyourfit.netlify.app`.



---

### Phase 5: Post-Launch & Growth (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Ensure the site is visible and up-to-date.

1. **Google My Business:**
* Create a free Google My Business profile and link it to your new website URL. This is vital for local SEO.


2. **Google Search Console & Analytics:**
* Set up free Google Analytics to track visitor numbers.
* Set up Google Search Console to tell Google your site exists so it can be indexed.


3. **Maintenance:**
* If you complete a great new custom project, take a photo and add it to your portfolio page by updating the HTML file and pushing the changes to GitHub. Netlify will update the live site automatically.
